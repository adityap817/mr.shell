## Overview

Shell++ is a custom command-line shell implemented in C++ that aims to provide an engaging, interactive terminal experience with advanced features beyond a basic shell. It supports:

- Colorful, dynamic prompts with fun sentences and emojis  
- Built-in commands like `cd`, `help`, `motivate` (inspirational quotes), `time` (show current time), and `exit`  
- Translation of simple English phrases to shell commands (e.g., "list files" â†’ `ls`)  
- Background execution of commands (using `&` suffix)  
- Easy extensibility for adding new built-in commands  
- No command history tracking (for privacy and simplicity)
